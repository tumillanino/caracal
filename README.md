A custom [bootc](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc) image built on Fedora Kinoite (KDE Plasma), tuned from the ground up for audio production. Caracal-OS delivers a fast, immutable Linux desktop with everything a producer or sound engineer needs — baked into the image, ready on first boot.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A machine running any bootc-compatible image (Bazzite, Bluefin, Aurora, or plain Fedora Atomic)
- A GitHub account (to pull the published image from GHCR)

### Switch to Caracal-OS

```bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/caracal-dev/caracal:latest
```

Reboot to apply. On first login, run the guided setup:

```bash
ujust first-run
```

That recipe adds you to the `audio` and `realtime` groups, installs the shell extras, and sets up yabridge.

Or do the group step manually:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG audio,realtime $USER
```

Then log out and back in for the group changes to take effect.

## Building Locally

Requires [just](https://just.systems/) and Podman.

Vital is not bundled with the image or build process. To install it after first boot:

```bash
# 1. Create an account at https://vital.audio and download the Linux RPM installer.
# 2. Change into the directory where you saved it, for example:
cd ~/Downloads

# 3. Install it on the host:
sudo rpm-ostree install VitalInstaller.rpm
```

Reboot after the `rpm-ostree` install completes.

```bash
# Build the container image
just build

# Build a bootable QCOW2 (for testing in a VM)
just build-qcow2

# Run in a VM
just run-vm-qcow2
```

See the [Justfile](./Justfile) for all available recipes.

## Image Verification

All published images are signed with [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign). Verify with:

```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/caracal-dev/caracal:latest
```
