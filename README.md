A custom [bootc](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc) image built on Fedora Kinoite (KDE Plasma), tuned from the ground up for audio production. Caracal-OS delivers a fast, immutable Linux desktop with a practical core production stack ready on first boot, while a much larger catalog of DAWs, plugins, and utilities is delivered through the bundled Caracal Software Installer.

## What's Inside

### Performance

- **Bazzite kernel** — replaces the stock Fedora kernel with Bazzite's pre-built OCI kernel image
- **CPU governor** — defaults to `performance` mode
- **Realtime/memlock limits** — `@audio` and `@realtime` groups preconfigured with `rtprio 95` and unlimited memlock through both PAM and `systemd`
- Preconfigured Wine/Yabridge compatibility for using Windows VST plugins

### DAWs (included)

| DAW | Notes |
|-----|-------|
| Ardour 9 | Full-featured professional DAW |
| Qtractor | MIDI/audio sequencer |
| Carla | Plugin host / patchbay |

**Also included:**

- Hydrogen
- QjackCtl
- Yabridge, Wine TKG, and Winetricks for Windows VST workflows

**Optional DAWs** (install after first boot via `ujust`):

```
ujust install-reaper
ujust install-renoise
ujust install-bitwig
ujust uninstall-reaper
ujust uninstall-renoise
ujust uninstall-bitwig
```

For the broader optional catalog, launch the bundled Caracal Software Installer from the app launcher or run:

```bash
ujust software-installer
```

### Plugins & Instruments

Plugins are installed system-wide in LV2, VST3, and CLAP formats where available.

**Included out of the box:**

- LSP Plugins (`lsp-plugins-vst`, `lsp-plugins-clap`, `lsp-plugins-lv2`)
- Calf
- Guitarix
- Vitalium (Vital without the online stuff)
- Dexed
- Loopino
- Crypt2
- LostAndFoundPiano
- Samplv1, Synthv1, Drumkv1
- Carla LV2 integration

**Optional installs available through Caracal Software Installer:**

- REAPER, Renoise, Bitwig Studio
- Cardinal, Surge XT, Decent Sampler, Loopino
- SunVox, Virtual ANS, TAL-Noisemaker, Wavetable
- INTERSECT, Audio Assault plugins, RTCQS

**Windows VST support:**

- Wine TKG + Yabridge — run Windows VST2/VST3 plugins natively inside Linux DAWs

### Getting More Plugins

If you are coming from Windows, the easiest path is:

1. Start with the Caracal Software Installer.
2. If what you want is not there yet, check [LinuxDAW.org](https://linuxdaw.org/), which is a useful Linux plugin catalog.
3. Download Linux plugin builds in formats like `VST3`, `CLAP`, or `LV2`.
4. Copy the downloaded plugin into your home plugin folders:
   - `~/.vst3`
   - `~/.clap`
   - `~/.lv2`
5. Re-scan plugins in your DAW or restart the DAW.

If those folders do not exist yet, you might not have run the 'ujust first-run' step. To set this up, open Alacritty and run 'ujust first-run'. On Linux, folders that start with a `.` are hidden by default, so in a file manager you may need to enable "Show Hidden Files" first. You can do this by pressing Ctrl+H while in the Home directory.

### Audio Stack

- JACK (`jack-audio-connection-kit`, `qjackctl`, `ffado` for FireWire interfaces)
- PipeWire + ALSA bridge (`pipewire-alsa`, `pavucontrol`)
- Core audio workflow tools aimed at low-latency Linux production

### Shell & Tooling

- Zsh + Oh My Zsh (pre-configured)
- `eza`, `zoxide`, `fzf`, `ugrep`, `fd`
- Neovim, Alacritty, 7zip, rsync

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A machine running any bootc-compatible image (Bazzite, Bluefin, Aurora, or plain Fedora Atomic)
- A GitHub account (to pull the published image from GHCR)

### Switch to Caracal-OS

```bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/caracal-dev/caracal:latest
```

Reboot to apply. On first login, run the guided setup:

```bash
ujust first-run
```

That recipe adds you to the `audio` and `realtime` groups, installs the shell extras, and sets up yabridge.

Or do the group step manually:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG audio,realtime $USER
```

Then reboot, or at minimum log out and back in, so the new group membership and session limits take effect.

## Building Locally

Requires [just](https://just.systems/) and Podman.

```bash
# Build the container image
just build

# Build a bootable QCOW2 (for testing in a VM)
just build-qcow2

# Run in a VM
just run-vm-qcow2
```

See the [Justfile](./Justfile) for all available recipes.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and strongly encouraged.

Caracal is trying to cover a wide surface area: audio production workflows, realtime tuning, plugin compatibility, desktop integration, bootc/Fedora Atomic image building, and hardware-specific behavior across laptops, desktops, audio interfaces, GPUs, MIDI devices, and controllers. That is too much for one person to validate alone, so more contributors directly improves the project.

If you use Caracal and find a bug, regression, packaging issue, compatibility problem, or workflow rough edge, please open an issue. If you already know the fix, open a pull request.

Helpful contribution areas include:

- Testing on different hardware: laptops, desktops, AMD/NVIDIA/Intel graphics, USB audio interfaces, MIDI controllers, and unusual audio chipsets
- Verifying DAW and plugin compatibility across Ardour, Carla, Qtractor, REAPER, Renoise, Bitwig, Wine, and yabridge
- Improving the base image, installer, branding, first-run flow, and desktop integration
- Fixing packaging and build issues in the image, installer scripts, and `ujust` recipes
- Improving documentation for setup, troubleshooting, plugin paths, hardware quirks, and known-good workflows

Suggested contribution flow:

1. Fork the repo and create a branch for your change.
2. Build locally with `just build`, or use `just build-qcow2` if you want to test in a VM.
3. Make the smallest focused change you can.
4. Include clear reproduction steps, hardware details, logs, or screenshots when reporting or fixing a bug.
5. Open a pull request with a concise summary of what changed and how you tested it.

When filing compatibility reports, the most useful details are:

- Hardware model and CPU/GPU
- Audio interface or MIDI device
- Whether the issue is on bare metal or in a VM
- What DAW, plugin, or workflow was involved
- Exact steps to reproduce
- Relevant logs, terminal output, or screenshots

Even small contributions help. A tested fix, a better doc note, a hardware report, or a reproducible bug report all reduce the amount of guesswork and make Caracal more reliable for everyone.
